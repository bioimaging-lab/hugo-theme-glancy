We study the neurobiology of energy balance. Using cutting-edge approaches, we are working to understand the molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms through which the brain regulates food intake and energy expenditure. We are also developing novel technologies to better understand how the brain effects changes in behavior and physiology. Most recently, we have focused our research on two small populations of cells within the brainstemâ€™s dorsal raphe nucleus, which can bidirectionally regulate both food intake and energy expenditure. We believe that studying these neurons may elucidate novel biological mechanisms through which the brain regulates body weight, and maladaptive states that arise from CNS malfunction, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.
